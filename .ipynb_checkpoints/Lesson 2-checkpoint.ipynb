    "\n",
    "most of computer science boils down to search/decidability. in other words, an algorithm is a function that takes some input (eg data structure) and returns an answer (does this number exist in this set?). the more powerful a data structure, the less complicated an algorithm needs to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "### how will we construct abstract data structures?\n",
    "cover linear data structures today (ordered lists, stacks, queues, deques). we can implement any of these \"abstract\" data structures with primitives (eg nodes and pointers). we can also implement them with each other, as we will see later. \n",
    "\n",
    "### why do we care about sorting algorithms?\n",
    "think about searching through an unordered list (what's the time complexity?) versus ordered list binary search). if we plan to repeatedly operate on the data structure, why not sort it? then you get to use binary search (which is $o(log n)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "we will cover sorting algorithms. usually folks study algorithms after data structures, but we want to match algorithms to its data structures. we'll see that sorting algorithms (eg merge sort, bubble sort) match with the linear data structures we just learned."

    "A good example problem for showing algorithms with different orders of magnitude is the classic anagram detection problem for strings. One string is an anagram of another if the second is simply a rearrangement of the first. For example, 'heart' and 'earth' are anagrams. The strings 'python' and 'typhon' are anagrams as well. For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that the two strings in question are of equal length and that they are made up of symbols from the set of 26 lowercase alphabetic characters. Our goal is to write a boolean function that will take two strings and return whether they are anagrams.\n",
